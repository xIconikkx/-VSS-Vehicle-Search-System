Thank you for downloading [VSS] Vehicle Search System for FivePD!

INSTALLATION:

1. DRAG & DROP "VehicleSearchSystem" into FivePD Plugins Folder (#DO NOT RENAME FOLDER#)
2. OPEN FivePD "Fxmanifest.lua"
3. ADD './plugins/VehicleSearchSystem/items.json' to the "files { "" } section
3. OPTIONAL You can edit the items.json to add items. I would give "Nothing" in there to give you a chance of finding "Nothing"

For any suggestions or issues you can DM me on Discord.

Tested on multiple vehicles, sedans, couples, trucks etc.

* System checks every so often if the vehicle still exists, if it doesn't it will delete it from its memory & if it does exist and your far enough away it removes it from its memory also *)
