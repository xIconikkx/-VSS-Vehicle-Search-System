Thank you for downloading [VSS] Vehicle Search System for FivePD!

INSTALLATION:

1. DRAG & DROP "VehicleSearchSystem.net.dll" into FivePD Plugins Folder
2. OPEN FivePD "Fxmanifest.lua"
3. ADD './config/items.json' to the files { "" } section
3. OPTIONAL You can edit the items.json to add items. I would give "Nothing" in there to give you a chance of finding "Nothing"

## PLEASE ENSURE THERE ISN'T ANOTHER NEWTONSOFT.JSON BEEN LOADED IN YOUR PLUGINS OR CALLOUTS FOLDERS. THIS CAN CAUSE THE PLUGIN TO NOT WORK/LOAD ##

For any suggestions or issues you can DM me on Discord.

Tested on multiple vehicles, sedans, couples, trucks etc.

* System checks every so often if the vehicle still exists, if it doesn't it will delete it from its memory & if it does exist and your far enough away it removes it from its memory also *)
